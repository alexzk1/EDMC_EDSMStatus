# EDMC_EDSMStatus
EDMC plugin that checks if a selected system has been uploaded to EDSM yet.

When in game open either the Galaxy map or the navigation window and select a system and lock onto it. You don't need to be able to jump to it. This tool will check if that system has been uploaded to EDSM yet and give you and audio cue if it has already been uploaded, "Dicovered", or has not been uploaded yet, "New System".
